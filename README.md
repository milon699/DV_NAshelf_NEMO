# DV_NAshelf_NEMO
This repository contains code from my WHOI guest student appointment in summer 2022. The project was to study (multi-)decadal variability and its impacts on the North Atlantic continental shelf using spatially highly-resolved ocean model data (NEMO/VIKING20X). Particularly, the strength of the shelf break jet was analyzed and its recently observed weakening was put into context of the larger scale decadal variability.

# DV_NAshelf_NEMO
This repository contains code from my WHOI guest student appointment in summer 2022. The project was to study (multi-)decadal variability and its impacts on the North Atlantic continental shelf. Particularly, the strength of the shelf break jet was analyzed and its recently observed weakening was put into context of the larger scale decadal variability.
